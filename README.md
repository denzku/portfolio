# Data Analysis Portfolio
## About Me

Hi, I am Deniz. With a background in Pharmacy/Pharmaceutical Industry, I am transitioning into the field of data analysis, where I am excited to apply my technical skills. Over the past months, I have been learning Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Excel, building the skills needed to be a data analyst.

My experiences in the pharmaceutical industry have taught me the importance of precision and attention to detailâ€”qualities that I now bring to analyzing and interpreting data. My goal is to use my healthcare expertise in data analysis to uncover meaningful insights, both within healthcare and in other fields.

This repository shows a variety of data analysis projects, in Python, SQL, and Tableau. The projects span multiple areas, including healthcare data analysis, certification requirements, and smaller-scale exploratory analyses.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Death Cause Analysis
This project is a comprehensive analysis of the leading causes of death in Russia, Japan, and the United States, exploring how these causes have evolved over time and highlighting regional differences. The project is structured to focus on significant trends and impactful events. Key components of this analysis include:

   - **Yearly Trends**: A deep dive into how various causes of death have shifted over the years, identifying patterns unique to each country.
   - **Pre-2005 Analysis**: A focused look at the leading causes of death before 2005, showing notable changes and emerging trends during this period.
   - **Top 5 Causes of Death**: An examination of the top causes of death for each country, capturing regional variations and underlying factors contributing to these causes.
   - **Regional Comparisons**: Comparative analysis of Russia with Eastern Europe, Japan with Asia, and the United States with America, providing insights into similarities and contrasts within and across regions.
   - **Continental Comparison via Heatmap**: A final comparative heatmap, visualizing differences in death causes across continents and showing a comprehensive view of global health inequalities.

### 2. Exams
This section contains projects completed as part of DataCamp's certification exams, reflecting a mix of SQL, fundamental, and intermediate skills:
   - **Associate Exam**: This SQL-based exam emphasizes foundational data analysis skills, testing core concepts.
   - **Data Analyst Exam**: A more intermediate assessment, this exam requires a comprehensive project presentation to DataCamp reviewers, involving deeper analysis and interpretation skills.

### 3. DataCamp Projects
These small-scale projects simulate real-life work scenarios where I follow specific instructions to complete tasks and provide data-driven answers. Each project explores specific data analysis techniques on small datasets, reinforcing essential skills in data wrangling, visualization, and interpretation.
